### Animated Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This Python script provides an example of animated data visualization using Matplotlib. The script loads data from a CSV file (`modified_data.csv`), interpolates the data for smoother animation, and then creates an animated plot.

#### Dependencies:
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy

#### Description:

1. **Loading Data**: The script loads data from a CSV file (`modified_data.csv`) using Pandas. The data is assumed to have a 'x' column representing the x-axis values and multiple columns representing different datasets to be plotted against the x-axis.

2. **Data Interpolation**: The script interpolates the loaded data to generate smoother curves for animation. It linearly interpolates the y-values for each dataset over a larger number of points (`x_i`) using NumPy's `interp` function.

3. **Animation Setup**: Matplotlib's `FuncAnimation` class is used to create the animation. The `myupdating` function is called for each frame of the animation.

4. **Updating Function**: The `myupdating` function updates the plot for each frame of the animation. It iterates over the datasets, updating the lines and text annotations accordingly. Additionally, it checks if the animation has reached the last frame and returns `False` to stop the animation.

5. **Plot Configuration**: The plot is configured with appropriate axis limits, legends, and labels.

6. **Display**: Finally, the animated plot is displayed using `plt.show()`.

#### Usage:
- Ensure that the CSV file (`modified_data.csv`) containing the data is in the same directory as the script.
- Run the script, and the animated plot will be displayed.
